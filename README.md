# Cleanfox
Method for clean, fast, private Firefox.

## Getting started
*If you don't have firefox already: [Get Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release)*

1) Download the user.js file [here](https://github.com/zJohnWick/Cleanfox-Config/raw/main/user.js) (Right click > `Save Link As…`).
2) Open Firefox. In the URL bar, type `about:profiles` and press **Enter**.
3) For the profile you want to use (or use default), click **Open Folder** in the **Root Directory** section.
4) Move the `user.js` file into the folder.
5) Done.
